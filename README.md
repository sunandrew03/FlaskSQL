# Stock Portfolio mock up

This project is an api that connects to a MySQL service that represents a stock trading and portfolio website. The database consists of customers, who make transactions, the information within these transactions (such as the stock, the price, the quantity, ...) and employees who help the customers. In addition to this functionality, the api supports capabilities to aggregate data to observe market trends and insights (such as popular stocks, sectors, ...).
